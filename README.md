# imagefinder
A demonstration React App that searches for images using the NASA image API and the Giphy API.

The app demonstrates using the public NASA image API and the Giphy image API to seach for images based upon user input in React components.

This app NO LONGER uses exposed API keys stored in an environment variable, which is bad practice because the keys can be inspected in the front end. The proper implementation should pass credentials from the server side using a hosting service such as Firebase or Vercel.
